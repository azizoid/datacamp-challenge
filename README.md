This is a Coding Challenge

## Files

### `markdownParser.js`
This file defines the custom Markdown renderer using the `marked` library. It includes the following customizations:
- **Headings**: Renders `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` tags with specific classes for font size and margin.
- **Paragraphs**: Renders paragraphs with classes for margin and text size.
- **Code Blocks**: Renders fenced code blocks with classes for background color, border, padding, and language-specific syntax highlighting.

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm run test
```
